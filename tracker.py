Expense Tracker Module

This module contains the core business logic for the Penny Tracker application.
It orchestrates all expense operations including creation, retrieval, filtering,
editing, deletion, and summary generation.

The ExpenseTracker class acts as the main controller, coordinating between
the database layer (db.py) and the entity layer (entity.py) while handling
all business rules and logging.

Classes:
    ExpenseTracker: Main controller for expense management operations

Example:
    >>> tracker = ExpenseTracker()
    >>> tracker.add_expense(50, "food", "20-02-2026", "lunch")
    >>> expenses = tracker.view_all()
    >>> summary = tracker.monthly_summary(2, 2026)

        Edit an existing expense by its display ID.
        
        Updates one or more fields of an expense. Only the fields provided
        (not None) are updated. The updated expense is validated before
        being saved to ensure data integrity.
        
        Args:
            display_id (int): The display ID (1-indexed position) of the expense to edit
            amount (int or float, optional): New amount value. If None, amount is not changed.
            category (str, optional): New category. If None, category is not changed.
            date (str, optional): New date in DD-MM-YYYY format. If None, date is not changed.
            note (str, optional): New note/description. If None, note is not changed.
        
        Returns:
            bool: True if the expense was successfully updated
        
        Raises:
            ExpenseNotFoundError: If no expense exists at the given display_id
            InvalidAmountError: If the new amount is not positive
            EmptyFieldError: If the new category is empty
            InvalidDateError: If the new date format is invalid
        
        Example:
            >>> tracker = ExpenseTracker()
            >>> tracker.add_expense(50, "food", "20-02-2026", "lunch")
            >>> tracker.edit_expense(1, amount=75, note="expensive lunch")
            True

            >>> expense.note
            'expensive lunch'
            >>> expense.category  # Unchanged
            'food'
        
        Note:
            All field validations are performed after updating. If validation
            fails, the expense is not saved and an exception is raised.
            
            Category values are automatically converted to lowercase.
            Amount values are automatically converted to float.
